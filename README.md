## dom-util
- Search DOM and build XPATH queries, Selenium web elements, or jsoup elements based on label texts automatically.
- Page Object Model code generator.
- For those who need to find HTML locators in DOM using CSS Selector or XPATH, this is a better and time-saving way to go, saying goodbye to manually constructing XPATH and CSS locators for each HTML web element in DOM.
- This helps much in the area of web service and Selenium-based Web UI testing, making Selenium-based UI testing much easier and more fun amd more importantly saving development and maintenance time, effort and cost.
- Unlike other free and commercial DOM capture or record and playback tools in the market which capture xpath locators using everything including HTML attributes (can be autogenerated and dynamic), which is fragile and most of the time, unusable. This dom-util gives you the xpath locators which are based on texts and relative DOM structure without using html attributes. So what you see from a web page is what you get.

## How to use:
 - Locate anchor web element on a web page under test such as a label closest to the web element to search
 - Get the information about the **anchor web element**: tag name, and own text
    i.e. ```<div jsname="YRMmle" class="AxOyFc snByac" aria-hidden="true">First name</div> --> tag: div, and text: First name```
 - Get the tag name or any css selector of the element to search, i.e. 'input'
 - Pass them to a method of DomUtil. 

## Notes: 
 * Each method in dom-util often goes in 3 overloads. For instance, getWebElementExactMatch, getWebElement, getWebElementBestEffort.
 * The **ExactMatch** overload compares the text with case sensitive and equals and trimming all the tabs and spaces.
 * The normal overload tries the exact matching first and if fails it tries the case sensitive and containing and trimming all the tabs and spaces.
 * The **BestEffort** overload tries to find the element similar to what the normal overload does but even when multiple anchors have been found, it will tries hard as well. Non best effort overloads will throw 'AmbiguousAnchorElementsException' when multiple anchors have been found.   
 * If you want to further control the options, use the overloads having parameter ElementInfo where you can specify the search condition combinations of your choice.
 * There are overloads such as findElement**WithTwoAnchors** as well for the convenience. It can be used where a web page has a label (parent anchor) and then another label underneath (anchor) and then the web element you want to find. For instance, it can be used for a question then 2 radio buttons with labels 'Yes' and 'No'.

## Examples:

        String url = "https://test.com.au/dom-util-test";
        WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
        driver.get(url);        

        //Document: jsoup document
        //Element: jsoup element
        //WebElement: Selenium web element
        DomUtil domUtil = new DomUtil();
        
        WebElement location = domUtil.getWebElement(driver, "Location", "input");
        location.sendKeys("test");      
        domUtil.getWebElementBestEffort(driver, "span", "Next", "button").click();
        domUtil.getWebElementBestEffort(driver, "Next", "button").click();
        domUtil.getWebElementBestEffort(driver, "Next", "div>button").click();
        
        String firstName = domUtil.getXpathsBestEffort(document, "div", "First name", "div>input").get(0);
        String userName = domUtil.getXpath(document, "Username", "input"); 
        //returns: "//div[div[contains(text(),'Username')]]/input[@id='1111'][@name='User Name']";
        
        String lastName = domUtil.getXpathBestEffort(document, "div", "Last name", "input");
        lastName = domUtil.getXpathBestEffort(document, "Last name", "input");
        String middleName = domUtil.getXpath(document, "Middle Name", "div span input");
        
        Element doB = domUtil.getElement(document, "div", "Date of Birth", "input");
        Elements address = domUtil.getElements(document, "Address", "input").get(1);
        String jsNameAttributeValue = address.attr("jsname");
        
        domUtil.getWebElementWithTwoAnchorsBestEffort(driver, "div","your first time using our service?", "span", "Yes",  "input").click();

        //Code generation example for Google Sign-up page.
        //Users of this dom-util need to implement ICodeGenAssociation interface to inject their Selenium wrappers
        //into the code generation function of the dom-util. SeleniumCodeGenAssociation is the default implementation.
        Document document = domUtil.getActiveDocument(driver);
        ICodeGenAssociation codeGenAssociation = new SeleniumCodeGenAssociation();
        CodeGenerator codeGenerator = new CodeGenerator(document, codeGenAssociation);
        String className = codeGenerator.getCodeGenClassName();
        String folder = CodeGeneratorTest.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation().getPath();
        String fileName = folder + File.separator + className + "Generated.java";
        codeGenerator.generatePageObjectModelClass(fileName);
